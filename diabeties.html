        <h3 >Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.</h3>

        <h1>There are two types in diabetes</h1>
        <h2>Type 1</h2>
        <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your pancreas doesn't make insulin or makes very little insulin. Insulin helps blood sugar enter the cells in your body for use as energy. Without insulin, blood sugar can't get into cells and builds up in the bloodstream. High blood sugar is damaging to the body and causes many of the symptoms and complications of diabetes.
            <b>Type 1 diabetes was once called insulin-dependent or juvenile diabetes</b>. It usually develops in children, teens, and young adults, but it can happen at any age.</p>
            <p><b>A simple blood test</b> will let you know if you have diabetes. If you were tested at a health fair or pharmacy, follow up at a clinic or doctor’s office. That way you’ll be sure the results are accurate.

                If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, your blood may also be tested for autoantibodies. These substances indicate your body is attacking itself and are often found with type 1 diabetes but not with type 2. You may have your urine tested for ketones too. Ketones are produced when your body burns fat for energy. Having ketones in your urine indicates you have type 1 diabetes instead of type 2.</p>
                
                <div class="parallax2">
                    
                </div>

                <h2>Type 2</h2>
                <p><b>Type 2 diabetes is often a milder form of diabetes than type 1</b>. Nevertheless, type 2 diabetes can still cause major health complications, particularly to the eyes, nerves and kidneys (similar to type 1). Also, like type 1, type 2 diabetes increases your risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
                    
                <p>Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or adult-onset) results from the body's ineffective use of insulin.<b>More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity.</b> </p>
                  <p> <b>Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes</b> but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen.</p>

                <li>
                    Lose extra weight. Losing weight reduces the risk of diabetes.
                </li>

            </h4>
            <p>
               <b>Losing weight reduces the risk of diabetes.</b> People in one large study reduced their risk of developing diabetes by almost 60% after losing approximately 7% of their body weight with changes in exercise and diet.

                 <p>The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of their body weight to prevent disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater benefits.</p>

                 <p>Set a weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>
                <li>
                    Be more physically active. There are many benefits to regular physical activity.
                </li>
            </h4>
            <p>
                <b>Aerobic exercise. Aim for 30 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise</b> — such as brisk walking, swimming, biking or running — on most days for a total of at least 150 minutes a week.</p>
<p>Resistance exercise. Resistance exercise — at least 2 to 3 times a week — increases your strength, balance and ability to maintain an active life. Resistance training includes weightlifting, yoga and calisthenics.</p>
<p>Limited inactivity. Breaking up long bouts of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>

            <p>
                Plants provide vitamins, minerals and carbohydrates in your diet. Carbohydrates include sugars and starches — the energy sources for your body — and fiber. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage or bulk, is the part of plant foods your body can't digest or absorb.</p>

<p><b>Fiber-rich foods promote weight loss and lower the risk of diabetes</b>. Eat a variety of healthy, fiber-rich foods, which include,

Fruits, such as tomatoes, peppers and fruit from trees
Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, broccoli and cauliflower
Legumes, such as beans, chickpeas and lentils
Whole grains, such as whole-wheat pasta and bread, whole-grain rice, whole oats, and quinoa
