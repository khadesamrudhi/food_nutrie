        <h2>
            Good nutrition during pregnancy can help to keep you and your developing baby healthy. Your need for certain nutrients (such as iron, iodine and folate) increases when you are pregnant.
        </h2>

            <h2>A varied diet that includes the right amount of healthy foods from the 5 food groups generally provides our bodies with the vitamins and minerals it needs each day. However, pregnant women may need to take vitamin or mineral supplements during pregnancy (such as folate and vitamin D).
          </h2>
          <h4>Consult your doctor before taking any supplements. They may recommend that you have a blood test or see a dietitian to review your need to take a supplement. You shouldn’t need to take a vitamin D supplement other than if you have been diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency through a blood test.

        <h2>Food to avoid in pregnancy</h2>
        <p>
            You want what's best for your baby. That's why you add <b>sliced fruit to your fortified breakfast </b>cereal, top your salads with chickpeas and snack on almonds. But do you know what foods to avoid during pregnancy?<b> Here's help understanding pregnancy nutrition basics.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Avoid seafood high in mercury
        </h3>
        <p>
            Seafood can be a great source of protein, and the omega-3 fatty acids in many fish can promote your baby's brain and eye development. However, <b>some fish and shellfish contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury</b>. Too much mercury could harm your baby's developing nervous system.

The bigger and older the fish, the more mercury it's likely to contain. During pregnancy, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages you to avoid:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Bigeye tuna</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>King mackerel</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Marlin</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Orange roughy</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Catfish</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Avoid excess caffeine</h3>
        <p>
           <b>While caffeine can cross the placenta, the effects on your baby aren't clear.</b> To be safe, your health care provider might recommend avoiding or limiting the amount of caffeine in your diet to less than 200 milligrams (mg) a day during pregnancy.
        </p>
<p>For perspective, an 8-ounce (240-milliliters, or mL) cup of brewed coffee contains <b>about 95 mg of caffeine, an 8-ounce (240-mL) cup of brewed tea contains about 47 mg and a 12-ounce (360-mL) caffeinated cola contains about 33 mg.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Avoid alcohol
        </h3>
        <p>
            No level of alcohol has been proved safe during pregnancy. The safest bet is to avoid alcohol entirely.
        </p>
<p><b>Consider the risks. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy leads to a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. Drinking alcohol may also result in fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause facial deformities and intellectual disability.</b>
</p>
<p>If you're concerned about alcohol you drank before you knew you were pregnant or you think you need help to stop drinking, consult your health care provider.
